 朝廷從其議","In the time of Emperor Wu of the Jin 晉武帝 (founder of Jin 晉dynasty, r. 265-290), He Jian Prefecture was home to a couple who secretly fell in love and accordingly promised each other in marriage.
 Following this, the man was conscripted into the army and for many years did not return.
 The girl’s family increasingly desired to marry her off to another suitor but she refused to go along with this.
 Her parents forced her, and, with no other options, she was sent off. In short time, [however,] she became sick and passed away. 
 
 Thereupon, the man returned from guarding the frontier garrison and inquired the whereabouts of the girl.
 The family explained it all to him [and] he thereafter came to the tomb in order to express his grief for her, at which point he was so overcome with emotion that he then [burst] open the tomb and unsealed the coffin.
 Immediately the girl came back to life, and he carried her home. 
 
 The man helped her recuperate and within a few days she was healed just as she was before.
 Later, [her] husband , upon hearing this, thereupon came to retrieve her, but the man would not give her back, saying:
 « Your wife, sir, has died. Where in the world as one heard of a dead person who could be brought back to life? This [woman] was bestowed upon me by Heaven; [she] is not your wife. » 
 
 Accordingly, they brought the matter to court, but the regional court could not render a verdict and sent the case to be considered at the Commandant of Justice , where the secretary of that office, Wang Dao , memorialized the throne as follows:
 «Pure commitment achieved to the utmost, is reciprocated by Heaven and Earth. Therefore, the occurrence of death and subsequent resurrection is such an extraordinary event that it cannot be judged with ordinary li . It is requested that she be returned to the one who opened the tomb. »
 The imperial court supported this opinion."
